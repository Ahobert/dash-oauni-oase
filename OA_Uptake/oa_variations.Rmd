OA shares of German research institutions per sector. The color of the boxes groups sectors into universities with a typically high total journal publication output, research-oriented institutes with a medium journal publication output and practise oriented institutions with a comparatively low journal publication output. Colored circles display the OA shares for individual institutions, larger filled points highlight specific institutions upon selection.
