    "text": "Abstract:\nThis study investigates the development of open access (OA) to journal articles from authors affiliated with German universities and non-university research institutions in the period 2010–2018. Beyond determining the overall share of openly available articles, a systematic classification of distinct categories of OA publishing allowed us to identify different patterns of adoption of OA. Taking into account the particularities of the German research landscape, variations in terms of productivity, OA uptake and approaches to OA are examined at the meso-level and possible explanations are discussed. The development of the OA uptake is analysed for the different research sectors in Germany (universities, non-university research institutes of the Helmholtz Association, Fraunhofer Society, Max Planck Society, Leibniz Association, and government research agencies). Combining several data sources (incl. Web of Science, Unpaywall, an authority file of standardised German affiliation information, the ISSN-Gold-OA 3.0 list, and OpenDOAR), the study confirms the growth of the OA share mirroring the international trend reported in related studies. We found that 45% of all considered articles during the observed period were openly available at the time of analysis. Our findings show that subject-specific repositories are the most prevalent type of OA. However, the percentages for publication in fully OA journals and OA via institutional repositories show similarly steep increases. Enabling data-driven decision-making regarding the implementation of OA in Germany at the institutional level, the results of this study furthermore can serve as a baseline to assess the impact recent transformative agreements with major publishers will likely have on scholarly communication."

Traditional and altmetric indicators will test the validity of popular thesis on OA. We focus on most relevant thesis and influencing factors which are discussed in the literature and seek to validate the thesis, quantify the effects, show the causal associations and answer novel problems. We ask: wherein exists the “genuine” OA effect (e.g. increased citation and altmetric rates via accessibility)? In which extent appears the OA effect in difference constellations (combination of structural and author specific properties)?\nThe study bases on articles from the Web of Science databases. These articles will be aggregated differently for the three work packages, e.g. on the author level, and will be analyzed in a bibliometric and altmetric way. In addition, we will perform quantitative surveys, interviews and workshops with authors who have published in OA and/or cited/shared OA to validate the results from the bibliometrics and altmetric studies and to gain deeper insights in the discipline specific OA publishing and OA citing behavior. These insights will flow into a model of transdisciplinary and discipline specific influencing factors. The three work packages divide into structural (WP1) and author specific properties of OA publications (WP2), author surveys (WP3) and assume in a report of the OASE “lessons learned”."

X-axes show the Career age, which ranges from 1 to 16 years (year of first publication and 15 years after that), and y-axes the related centrality score. Using the filter, results of a specific gender can be displayed.\nComparing the centrality of mobile and non-mobile researchers in the co-authorship networks displays the position and role of mobile researchers in these networks. For mobile researchers, we observe a growing trend in degree and coreness by increasing the career age. These two observations suggest that not only mobility increases the social capital of the scholars (degree), but also it helps to position the scholars into the core of the community which would allow them to get better access to highly influential people. In contrast, the lower clustering coefficient of mobile researchers indicates that by increasing their degree, they diversify their co-authors and belong to various communities and thus they act more as bridges between the communities.\nFor more information about the definition of centrality scores , please see the paper, section 3.6."

Quantitative research in this context is designed to improve our understanding of the science system’s workings, structural dependencies and dynamics.

The research design induces three areas of work, which will be addressed at Göttingen State and University Library and at the Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies of Science (I²SoS) Bielefeld:\n\nGeneration of university OA publication profiles: Publication data of German universities in the period 2008 to 2017 from the Web of Science database of the Competence Center Bibliometry (WoS-CB) will be supplemented with information on OA status by novel OA detection sources such as Unpaywall Data, which are to be made accessible for bibliometric analyses in a preceding step.\nEstablishment of determinants of university OA profiles: In order to explain the differences in the publication profiles, the influence of organizational factors such as the locally available OA infrastructure or financial support offers and subject-specific factors such as the respective publication culture will be examined. Both factors will be integrated into explanatory models and statistically tested. The corresponding information is again collected from the WoS-CB database in combination with OA detection sources as well as from established data sources in research on science and university reporting.\nValidation of results by means of semi-structured expert interviews: Possible further factors that could influence the OA profile of universities are to be identified in interviews with those responsible for OA at universities. However, this does not serve to expand the focus of the analysis, but rather to assess the research results, that is, to determine the informative value and limits of the quantitative explanatory model.\n\nThe project aims to improve the understanding of current transformation processes in the scientific publication system. It thus also addresses current challenges in the areas of scientific literature supply and public participation in the scientific knowledge process. The results, including the data and analytical routines, will be prepared for specific target groups and, if legally possible, published under an open license. With this, the project also contributes to the development of a methodology and the creation of data resources for a monitoring of the development towards OA publishing."

    "text": "The project studies systematically, longitudinally and comprehensively the structural and author specific influencing factors of OA impact in the social sciences, economics and selected sciences. Traditional and altmetric indicators will test the validity of popular thesis on OA. We focus on most relevant thesis and influencing factors which are discussed in the literature and seek to validate the thesis, quantify the effects, show the causal associations and answer novel problems. We ask: wherein exists the “genuine” OA effect (e.g. increased citation and altmetric rates via accessibility)? In which extent appears the OA effect in difference constellations (combination of structural and author specific properties)?\nThe study bases on articles from the Web of Science databases. These articles will be aggregated differently for the three work packages, e.g. on the author level, and will be analyzed in a bibliometric and altmetric way. In addition, we will perform quantitative surveys, interviews and workshops with authors who have published in OA and/or cited/shared OA to validate the results from the bibliometrics and altmetric studies and to gain deeper insights in the discipline specific OA publishing and OA citing behavior. These insights will flow into a model of transdisciplinary and discipline specific influencing factors. The three work packages divide into structural (WP1) and author specific properties of OA publications (WP2), author surveys (WP3) and assume in a report of the OASE “lessons learned”."
