Using these features and employing a machine learning classification method, we examined the driving factors of OA publishing and importance of each feature in estimating the publishing model of articles. Data have been selected from articles published by Springer Nature between 2017 and 2018. Using descriptive statistics we present the relationship between APC waiver and discount policies with OA publishing by comparing the publishing model of authors regarding the income level of their affiliation country. Also, we compared the citation impact of these authors’ publications."

    "text": "The science sector has been acquiring great significance for more and more areas of our society. This makes it all the more important for the science system to be structured and funded as advantageously as possible. To an increasing degree, quality and productivity issues in science and research are being studied with the help of indicators that yield information about quality, the factors that define it and the factors that bring it about. One aim of the funding line “Quantitative research on the science sector” is to make even better use of such indicators’ usefulness for research on the science system – and, in the process, to develop new indicators where appropriate. Quantitative research in this context is designed to improve our understanding of the science system’s workings, structural dependencies and dynamics. It also considers the impacts of data-based evaluation of research."

    "text": "With its science-reflective and insight-oriented objective, the project differs from initiatives that focus on the infrastructural implementation of OA. The research design induces three areas of work, which will be addressed at Göttingen State and University Library and at the Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies of Science (I²SoS) Bielefeld:\n\nGeneration of university OA publication profiles: Publication data of German universities in the period 2008 to 2017 from the Web of Science database of the Competence Center Bibliometry (WoS-CB) will be supplemented with information on OA status by novel OA detection sources such as Unpaywall Data, which are to be made accessible for bibliometric analyses in a preceding step.\nEstablishment of determinants of university OA profiles: In order to explain the differences in the publication profiles, the influence of organizational factors such as the locally available OA infrastructure or financial support offers and subject-specific factors such as the respective publication culture will be examined. Both factors will be integrated into explanatory models and statistically tested. The corresponding information is again collected from the WoS-CB database in combination with OA detection sources as well as from established data sources in research on science and university reporting.\nValidation of results by means of semi-structured expert interviews: Possible further factors that could influence the OA profile of universities are to be identified in interviews with those responsible for OA at universities. However, this does not serve to expand the focus of the analysis, but rather to assess the research results, that is, to determine the informative value and limits of the quantitative explanatory model.\n\nThe project aims to improve the understanding of current transformation processes in the scientific publication system. It thus also addresses current challenges in the areas of scientific literature supply and public participation in the scientific knowledge process. The results, including the data and analytical routines, will be prepared for specific target groups and, if legally possible, published under an open license. With this, the project also contributes to the development of a methodology and the creation of data resources for a monitoring of the development towards OA publishing."

    "text": "The project studies systematically, longitudinally and comprehensively the structural and author specific influencing factors of OA impact in the social sciences, economics and selected sciences. Traditional and altmetric indicators will test the validity of popular thesis on OA. We focus on most relevant thesis and influencing factors which are discussed in the literature and seek to validate the thesis, quantify the effects, show the causal associations and answer novel problems. We ask: wherein exists the “genuine” OA effect (e.g. increased citation and altmetric rates via accessibility)? In which extent appears the OA effect in difference constellations (combination of structural and author specific properties)?\nThe study bases on articles from the Web of Science databases. These articles will be aggregated differently for the three work packages, e.g. on the author level, and will be analyzed in a bibliometric and altmetric way. In addition, we will perform quantitative surveys, interviews and workshops with authors who have published in OA and/or cited/shared OA to validate the results from the bibliometrics and altmetric studies and to gain deeper insights in the discipline specific OA publishing and OA citing behavior. These insights will flow into a model of transdisciplinary and discipline specific influencing factors. The three work packages divide into structural (WP1) and author specific properties of OA publications (WP2), author surveys (WP3) and assume in a report of the OASE “lessons learned”."
