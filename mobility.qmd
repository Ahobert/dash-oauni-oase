This study investigates international academic mobility from different aspects. The authors included in this study are those indexed in Scopus from all countries and scientific fields. We compared the mobility among countries, gender, and fields to show the inequalities. We considered the scholars' career stages in our analyses for a more comprehensive analysis. This supplementary visualization will better present the mobility patterns among scholars with various socio-demographic characteristics. The paper has been published by 'Journl Of Informetrics' and the accepted version is available via [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2203/2203.06995.pdf).
